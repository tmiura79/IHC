# IHC

This code is for computing the effects of inhomogeneities of the universe on the measurement of the Hubble constant and used for our paper [1].

This repository contains four independent numerical computation codes. Each code is located in a separate folder.

## Folder Structure

- `adhe_o` - This folder contains code for calculation of the Hubble constant in the adhesion model. 
- `adhe_a` - This folder contains code for calculation of the Hubble constant in the adhesion model. Multiple calculations are performed with different values of amplitude of the perturbation.
- `free_o` - This folder contains code for calculation of the Hubble constant in the freezing model. 
- `free_a` - This folder contains code for calculation of the Hubble constant in the freezing model. Multiple calculations are performed with different values of amplitude of the perturbation.

Each folder contains a README.md file with detailed information about that specific code.
